    The database has a table named 'covid_vaccinations', which is like a simple record book for COVID-19 vaccination details. It includes a special code (Statistic Code) for identifying the type of vaccination data, along with a descriptive name or title (Statistic Label) for that data. Each entry is marked with a time identifier, such as the month it was recorded, and specifies the local area where the vaccinations were carried out. There are also columns with unclear codes (Code 1 and Code 2), whose exact purposes aren't immediately apparent. The table lists the age groups of people receiving vaccinations and possibly the measurement unit used in the data. Finally, there's a 'Value' column, which shows the actual numbers, like the count of vaccinations given, making it a straightforward way to track where, when, and to whom COVID-19 vaccinations were administered.
